Currently the Bambu Studio application does not allow you to import and export profiles, you can copy them to the application directory:

[Windows]
- Cloud user: C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\BambuStudio\user\XXXXXXXXXXXX\filament
- Local user: C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\BambuStudio\user\default\filament
